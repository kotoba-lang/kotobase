  "The read path that cannot be taken without authority.

  `kotobase.authorized-query` was the right gate and had exactly one caller:
  its own test. A gate nothing goes through is a gate, an unguarded read path,
  and a document saying reads are authorised — and the document is the part
  people believe.

  This namespace is the composition that was missing. It is deliberately *not*
  a change to `kotobase.core`: breaking `q`/`query`/`pull` would break every
  consumer in the workspace at once, and a migration nobody can complete is
  how a safe path ends up bypassed for real work. So the guarded path is added,
  the unguarded one keeps working, and which is which is a fact a test can
  check rather than a claim in prose (see `kotobase.guarded-surface-test`).

  Four things are required together, because each alone is defeated:

  - a **policy** that admits the query at one immutable basis. Admission, not
    redaction: a Datalog query with an unconstrained join leaks through
    existence and aggregation whatever you do to the rows afterwards.
  - a **classified schema**, so the policy's projection can be reasoned about
    at all. Without it `:mail/body` and `:mail/thread` are the same shape.
  - the **grant** the caller holds, as classes and erasure scopes.
  - a **receipt sink** that says it persisted. `kotobase.admission` refuses to
    run an effect until its audit is durable; a read that leaves nothing
    behind is the same hole on the other side."
