  "What each attribute is, so a projection can be reasoned about.

  `kotobase.authorized-query` already narrows a read to a set-valued
  `:projection`, which is the right shape: the boundary is admission, not
  redaction, because a Datalog query with an unconstrained join leaks through
  existence and aggregation whatever you do to the rows afterwards.

  What the gate cannot do on its own is say *which* attributes matter. A
  policy that names `:mail/body` and one that names `:mail/thread` are the
  same shape to it. So the schema declares a class per attribute, and two
  things follow that a schema alone cannot enforce:

  1. An attribute with no class cannot be queried. Not `:internal` by
     default — a default is how personal data acquires the wrong class
     without anybody deciding.

  2. An attribute above `:internal` cannot hold its value inline. It holds a
     content address, and the bytes live behind a separate grant. This is
     what makes erasure possible at all: the chain preserves retracted facts
     on purpose (that is what an audit view is for), so a body written inline
     can never be erased, while a key can be destroyed."
