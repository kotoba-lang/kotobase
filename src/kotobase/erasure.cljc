(ns kotobase.erasure
  "Binding an erasure scope to a key, so that erasure is something that can
  actually be done and afterwards told apart from loss.

  The chain preserves retracted facts on purpose (ADR-2607071610: that is what
  an audit view is for). A datom cannot be unwritten, so `erase this person's
  data` is only answerable if the value was never in the chain to begin with —
  it is a content address, and the bytes are sealed under a key that can be
  destroyed. `kotobase.classification` is what forces sensitive attributes into
  that shape; this namespace is what makes the second half true.

  The plane holds no crypto and no vault. `kagi` already has the whole key
  lifecycle — unlock → VMK → compartment key → per-item DEK → AES-256-GCM, with
  NIST-shaped states and a transition table where `:destroyed` is reachable only
  from `:revoked` or `:decrypt-or-verify-only`, so an active key cannot be
  destroyed by accident. So this namespace does not implement any of it: the
  host injects a `key-state` lookup, and kagi is one implementation of it.

  The distinction this exists for: **absent because erased and absent because
  missing must not look the same.** One is a completed obligation with a record;
  the other is a fault. A reader who cannot tell them apart will report a broken
  store as a fulfilled deletion request, or the reverse."
